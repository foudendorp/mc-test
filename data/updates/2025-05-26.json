An EPM elevation rule set to Deny blocks the specified file from running in an elevated context. While we recommend using file elevation rules to allow users to elevate specific files, a deny rule can help you ensure that certain files like known and potentially malicious software can't be run in an elevated context. Deny rules support the same configuration options as other elevation types except for child processes, which aren't used. For more information about EPM, which is available as an Intune Suite add-on-capability, see Endpoint Privilege Management overview.",
