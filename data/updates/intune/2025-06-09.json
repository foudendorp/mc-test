This capability is available from the <a href=\"https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431\">Microsoft Intune admin center</a> by selecting <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>All apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Create</strong>. The ARM64 option is available by selecting the <strong>Operating system architecture</strong> option under the <strong>Requirements</strong> step. To ensure that you don't have any impact to any Win32 applications that you previously targeted to 64-bit devices, your existing 64-bit Win32 applications will also have ARM64 selected. After the availability of being able to specifically target ARM64 operating system architectures, selecting x64 won't target ARM64 devices.</p><p>For related information, see <a href=\"../apps/apps-win32-app-management\">Win32 app management in Microsoft Intune</a>.</p><p>Applies to:</p><ul><li>Windows devices</li></ul>",
