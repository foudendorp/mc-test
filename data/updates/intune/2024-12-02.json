As a result of this change, we updated the behavior that occurs when you select <strong>Determine based on user choice</strong> as the enrollment profile type for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) enrollments.</p><p>Now when users select <strong>I own this device</strong> during a BYOD enrollment, Microsoft Intune enrolls them via account-driven user enrollment, rather than profile-based user enrollment, and then secures only work-related apps. Less than one percent of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices. There is no change for iOS users who select <strong>My company owns this device</strong> during a BYOD enrollment. Intune enrolls them via device enrollment with Intune Company Portal, and then secures their entire device.</p><p>If you currently allow users in BYOD scenarios to determine their enrollment profile type, you must take action to ensure account-driven user enrollment works by completing all prerequisites. For more information, see <a href=\"../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment\">Set up account driven Apple user enrollment</a>.
