          "content": "<p>Custom Attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services is now Generally Available. This capability allows customers to use Custom Attributes in their managed domains. Legacy applications often rely on custom attributes created in the past to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over resources. For example, these applications might use custom attributes to store an employee ID in their directory and rely on these attributes in their application LDAP calls. Modifying legacy applications can be costly and risky, and customers might lack the necessary skills or knowledge to make these changes. Microsoft Entra Domain Services now supports custom attributes, enabling customers to migrate their legacy applications to the Azure cloud without modification. It also provides support to synchronize custom attributes from Microsoft Entra ID, allowing customers to benefit from Microsoft Entra ID services in the cloud.
