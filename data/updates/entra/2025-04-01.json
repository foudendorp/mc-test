By May 2025, suggestions will be enabled by default and we'll introduce a new card in the Microsoft Entra Admin Center Entitlement Management control configurations for admins to see My Access settings. We recommend admins turn on the peer-based insights for suggested access packages via this setting. For more information, see: Suggested access packages in My Access (Preview).",

The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect application sync process, we will, in the coming week roll out support for \"Application based Authentication\" (ABA), which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application based identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect will create a single tenant 3rd party application in customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, register a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorize the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization The Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change will be exclusively available in the Microsoft Entra admin center within the Microsoft Entra Connect pane.",
