This new background was designed to help users focus on signing into their accounts, enhancing productivity, and minimizing distractions. With this, we aim to ensure visual consistency and a clean, simplified user experience throughout Microsoft’s authentication flows – aligning with Microsoft’s modernized <a href=\"https://microsoft.design/articles/four-principles-for-the-future-of-design/\">Fluent</a> design language. When our experiences look and feel consistent, it gives our users a familiar experience that they know and trust.</p><p><strong>What’s changing?</strong></p><p>This update is solely a visual user interface refresh with no changes to functionality. This change will only affect screens where <a href=\"how-to-customize-branding\">Company Branding</a> doesn't apply or where users see the <a href=\"https://aka.ms/entradefaultbackground\">default background image</a>. We recommend updating any documentation that contains screenshots and notifying your help desk. If you have configured a custom background image in Company Branding for your tenant, there will be no change for your users.</p><p><strong>Additional Details:</strong></p><p>The following combinations are supported:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tenants without a custom background configured:</strong><br>\na. Tenants without a custom background will see the change on every authentication screen.<br>\nb. To change this background and use a custom background, configure <a href=\"how-to-customize-branding\">Company Branding</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tenants with a custom background configured:</strong><br>\na.

For all other screens, tenants with a custom background configured <strong>will see no change</strong> to their experience on all clients.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entra External ID Tenants will not see any change to their experience on all clients</strong></p></li></ol> <span class=\"product-capability\">- User Authentication</span>",
