          "content": "Starting September 29, 2025, we'll be making a change to the default background image of our Microsoft Entra work or school authentication screens. This new background was designed to help users focus on signing into their accounts, enhancing productivity, and minimizing distractions. With this, we aim to ensure visual consistency and a clean, simplified user experience throughout Microsoft’s authentication flows – aligning with Microsoft’s modernized Fluent design language. When our experiences look and feel consistent, it gives our users a familiar experience that they know and trust. What’s changing? This update is solely a visual user interface refresh with no changes to functionality. This change will only affect screens where Company Branding doesn't apply or where users see the default background image. We recommend updating any documentation that contains screenshots and notifying your help desk. If you have configured a custom background image in Company Branding for your tenant, there will be no change for your users.",
