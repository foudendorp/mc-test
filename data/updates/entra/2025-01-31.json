This phase will impact new and existing applications unless action is taken. The latest updates on Azure AD Graph retirement can be found here: <a href=\"https://aka.ms/AzureADGraphRetirement\">Take action by February 1: Azure AD Graph is retiring</a>.</p><p>Starting from February 1, both new and existing applications will be prevented from calling Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they're configured for an extension. You might not see impact right away, as we’re rolling out this change in stages across tenants. We anticipate full deployment of this change around the end of February, and by the end of March for national cloud deployments.</p><p>If you haven't already, it's now urgent to review the applications on your tenant to see which ones depend on Azure AD Graph API access, and mitigate or migrate these before the February 1 cutoff date. For applications that haven't migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs, <a href=\"/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http#allow-extended-azure-ad-graph-access-until-june-30-2025\">an extension</a> can be set to allow the application access to Azure AD Graph through June 30, 2025.</p><p>Microsoft Entra Recommendations are the best tool to identify applications that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant and require action.

          "subtitle": "General Availability",
          "content": "<p>Microsoft Security wants to ensure that all customers are aware of how to notice when a partner is accessing a downstream tenant's resources. Interactive sign-in logs currently provide a list of sign in events, but there's no clear indication of which logins are from partners accessing downstream tenant resources. For example, when reviewing the logs, you might see a series of events, but without any additional context, it’s difficult to tell whether these logins are from a partner accessing another tenant’s data.</p><p>Here's a list of steps that one can take to clarify which logins are associated with partner tenants:</p><p>The following combinations are supported:</p><ol><li>Take note of the  \"ServiceProvider\" value in the CrossTenantAccessType column:\n<ul><li>This filter can be applied to refine the log data. When activated, it immediately isolates events related to partner logins.</li></ul></li><li>Utilize the \"Home Tenant ID\" and \"Resource Tenant ID\" Columns:\n<ul><li>These two columns identify logins coming from the partner’s tenant to a downstream tenant.</li></ul></li></ol><p>After seeing a partner logging into a downstream tenant’s resources, an important follow-up activity to perform is to validate the activities that might have occurred in the downstream environment. Some examples of logs to look at are Microsoft Entra Audit logs for Microsoft Entra ID events, Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL) for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID events, and/or the Azure Monitor activity log for Azure events. By following these steps, you're able to clearly identify when a partner is logging into a downstream tenant’s resources and subsequent activity in the environment, enhancing your ability to manage and monitor cross-tenant access efficiently.</p><p>To increase visibility into the aforementioned columns, Microsoft Entra will begin enabling these columns to display by default when loading the sign-in logs UX starting on March 7, 2025.</p> <span class=\"product-capability\">- Monitoring & Reporting</span>",
