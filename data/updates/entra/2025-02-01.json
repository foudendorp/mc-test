In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by using the migration toggle in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, confirm the configuration, and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete.

You see a new authentication method ‘QR code’ in Microsoft Entra ID Authentication method Policies. You can enable and add QR code for your frontline workers via Microsoft Entra ID, My Staff, or MS Graph APIs. All users in your tenant see a new link ‘Sign in with QR code’ on navigating to https://login.microsoftonline.com > ‘Sign-in options’ > ‘Sign in to an organization’ page. This new link is visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). Users can use this auth method only if you add and provide a QR code to them. QR code auth is also available in BlueFletch and Jamf. MHS QR code auth support is generally available by early March. The feature has a ‘preview’ tag until it's generally available.

When this is live in a tenant where system preferred is enabled and users are in scope of an external auth methods policy, those users will be prompted for their external authentication method if their most secure registered method is Microsoft Authenticator notification. External Authentication Method will appear as third in the list of most secure methods. If the user has a Temporary Access Pass (TAP) or Passkey (FIDO2) device registered, they'll be prompted for those. In addition, users in the scope of an external auth methods policy will have the ability to delete all registered second factor methods from their account, even if the method being deleted is specified as the default sign in method or is system preferred.
