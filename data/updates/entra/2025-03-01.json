          "content": "Effective April 1, 2025, Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (MEPM) will no longer be available for sale to new Enterprise Agreement or direct customers. Additionally, starting May 1, it will not be available for sale to new CSP customers. Effective October 1, 2025, we will retire Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and discontinue support of this product. Existing customers will retain access to this product until September 30, 2025, with ongoing support for current functionalities. We have partnered with Delinea to provide an alternative solution, Privilege Control for Cloud Entitlements (PCCE), that offers similar capabilities to those provided by Microsoft Entra Permissions Management. The decision to phase out Microsoft Entra Permissions Management was done after deep consideration of our innovation portfolio and how we can focus on delivering the best innovations aligned to our differentiating areas and partner with the ecosystem on adjacencies. We remain committed to delivering top-tier solutions across the Microsoft Entra portfolio.

          "content": "Custom Attributes for Microsoft Entra Domain Services is now Generally Available. This capability allows customers to use Custom Attributes in their managed domains. Legacy applications often rely on custom attributes created in the past to store information, categorize objects, or enforce fine-grained access control over resources. For example, these applications might use custom attributes to store an employee ID in their directory and rely on these attributes in their application LDAP calls. Modifying legacy applications can be costly and risky, and customers might lack the necessary skills or knowledge to make these changes. Microsoft Entra Domain Services now supports custom attributes, enabling customers to migrate their legacy applications to the Azure cloud without modification. It also provides support to synchronize custom attributes from Microsoft Entra ID, allowing customers to benefit from Microsoft Entra ID services in the cloud.
