          "subtitle": "Type: Update",
          "content": "Microsoft Security wants to ensure that all customers are aware of how to notice when a partner is accessing a downstream tenant's resources. Interactive sign-in logs currently provide a list of sign in events, but there's no clear indication of which logins are from partners accessing downstream tenant resources. For example, when reviewing the logs, you might see a series of events, but without any additional context, it’s difficult to tell whether these logins are from a partner accessing another tenant’s data. Here's a list of steps that one can take to clarify which logins are associated with partner tenants: After seeing a partner logging into a downstream tenant’s resources, an important follow-up activity to perform is to validate the activities that might have occurred in the downstream environment. Some examples of logs to look at are Microsoft Entra Audit logs for Microsoft Entra ID events, Microsoft 365 Unified Audit Log (UAL) for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Entra ID events, and/or the Azure Monitor activity log for Azure events. By following these steps, you're able to clearly identify when a partner is logging into a downstream tenant’s resources and subsequent activity in the environment, enhancing your ability to manage and monitor cross-tenant access efficiently.",

Now, we’ve enhanced Microsoft Entra ID Protection to detect password spray attacks in real-time before the attacker ever obtains a token. This reduces remediation from hours to seconds by interrupting attacks during the sign-in flow. Risk-based Conditional Access can automatically respond to this new signal by raising session risk, immediately challenging the sign-in attempt, and stopping password spray attempts in their tracks. This cutting-edge detection, now Generally Available, works alongside existing detections for advanced attacks such as Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and token theft, to ensure comprehensive coverage against modern attacks.

Starting from February 1, both new and existing applications will be prevented from calling Azure AD Graph APIs, unless they're configured for an extension. You might not see impact right away, as we’re rolling out this change in stages across tenants. We anticipate full deployment of this change around the end of February, and by the end of March for national cloud deployments. If you haven't already, it's now urgent to review the applications on your tenant to see which ones depend on Azure AD Graph API access, and mitigate or migrate these before the February 1 cutoff date. For applications that haven't migrated to Microsoft Graph APIs, an extension can be set to allow the application access to Azure AD Graph through June 30, 2025.",
