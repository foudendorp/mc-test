In 2023, it was announced that the ability to manage authentication methods in the legacy MFA and SSPR policies would be retired in September 2025. Until now, organizations had to manually migrate methods themselves by using <a href=\"../identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-methods-manage#start-the-migration\">the migration toggle</a> in the converged policy. Now, you can migrate in just a few selections by using the migration guide. The guide evaluates what your organization currently has enabled in both legacy policies, and generates a recommended converged policy configuration for you to review and edit as needed. From there, confirm the configuration, and we set it up for you and mark your migration as complete.

This new link is visible only on mobile devices (Android/iOS/iPadOS). Users can use this auth method only if you add and provide a QR code to them. QR code auth is also available in BlueFletch and Jamf. MHS QR code auth support is generally available by early March.</p><p>The feature has a ‘preview’ tag until it's generally available.
