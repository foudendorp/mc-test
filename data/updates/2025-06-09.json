This capability is available from the Microsoft Intune admin center by selecting Apps > All apps > Create. The ARM64 option is available by selecting the Operating system architecture option under the Requirements step. To ensure that you don't have any impact to any Win32 applications that you previously targeted to 64-bit devices, your existing 64-bit Win32 applications will also have ARM64 selected. After the availability of being able to specifically target ARM64 operating system architectures, selecting x64 won't target ARM64 devices.
