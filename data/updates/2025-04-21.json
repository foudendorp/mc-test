When an elevation rule is configured to define one or more file arguments, EPM allows that file to run in an elevated request only when one of the defined arguments is used. EPM blocks elevation of the file should a command line argument be used that isn't defined by the elevation rule. Use of file arguments in your file elevation rules can help you refine how and for what intent different files are successfully run in an elevated context by Endpoint Privilege Management.
