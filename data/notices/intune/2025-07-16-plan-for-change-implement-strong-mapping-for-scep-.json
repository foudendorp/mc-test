  "content": "With the May 10, 2022, Windows update (KB5014754), changes were made to the Active Directory Kerberos Key Distribution (KDC) behavior in Windows Server 2008 and later versions to mitigate elevation of privilege vulnerabilities associated with certificate spoofing. Windows enforces these changes on February 11, 2025.\nTo prepare for this change, Intune has released the ability to include the security identifier to strongly map SCEP and PKCS certificates.
