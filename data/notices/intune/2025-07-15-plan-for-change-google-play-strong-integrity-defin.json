  "title": "Plan for Change: Google Play strong integrity definition update for Android 13 or above",
  "content": "Google recently updated the definition of \"Strong Integrity\" for devices running Android 13 or above, requiring hardware-backed security signals and recent security updates. For more information refer to the Android Developers Blog: Making the Play Integrity API faster, more resilient, and more private. Microsoft Intune will enforce this change by September 30, 2025. Until then we've adjusted app protection policy and compliance policy behavior to align with Googleâ€™s recommended backward compatibility guidance to minimize disruption as detailed in Improved verdicts in Android 13 and later devices | Google Play | Android Developers.",
