  "title": "Plan for change - Roll out of Application Based Authentication on Microsoft Entra Connect Sync",
  "content": "**Type:** Plan for change\n\n**Service category:** Microsoft Entra Connect\n\n**Product capability:** Microsoft Entra Connect\n**What is changing**\nMicrosoft Entra Connect creates and uses a [Microsoft Entra Connector account](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-accounts-permissions) to authenticate and sync identities from Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. The account uses a locally stored password to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enhance the security of the Microsoft Entra Connect application sync process, we will, in the coming week roll out support for \"Application based Authentication\" (ABA), which uses a Microsoft Entra ID application based identity and Oauth 2.0 client credential flow to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID. To enable this, Microsoft Entra Connect will create a single tenant 3rd party application in customer's Microsoft Entra ID tenant, register a certificate as the credential for the application, and authorize the application to perform on-premises directory synchronization\nThe Microsoft Entra Connect Sync .msi installation file for this change will be exclusively available in the Microsoft Entra admin center within the [Microsoft Entra Connect pane](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_Connect_Provisioning/AADConnectMenuBlade/%7E/GetStarted).\nCheck our [version history page](../identity/hybrid/connect/reference-connect-version-history) in the next week for more details of the change.",
