  "title": "Plan for Change: Google Play strong integrity definition update for Android 13 or above",
  "content": "Google recently updated the definition of \"Strong Integrity\" for devices running Android 13 or above, requiring hardware-backed security signals and recent security updates. For more information refer to the [Android Developers Blog: Making the Play Integrity API faster, more resilient, and more private](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/12/making-play-integrity-api-faster-resilient-private.html). Microsoft Intune will enforce this change by **September 30, 2025**. Until then we've adjusted app protection policy and compliance policy behavior to align with Googleâ€™s recommended backward compatibility guidance to minimize disruption as detailed in [Improved verdicts in Android 13 and later devices | Google Play | Android Developers](https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity/improvements#how_can_i_use_the_old_meets-strong-integrity_label_definition_across_all_android_sdk_versions).",
