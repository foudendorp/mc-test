  "content": "[Google has deprecated](https://blog.google/products/android-enterprise/da-migration/) Android device administrator management, continues to remove management capabilities, and no longer provides fixes or improvements. Due to these changes, Intune will be ending support for Android device administrator management on devices with access to Google Mobile Services (GMS) beginning **December 31, 2024**. Until that time, we support device administrator management on devices running Android 14 and earlier.
